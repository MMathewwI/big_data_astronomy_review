  abstract = {As the largest radio telescope in the world, the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) will lead the next generation of radio astronomy. The feats of engineering required to construct the telescope array will be matched only by the techniques developed to exploit the rich scientific value of the data. To drive forward the development of efficient and accurate analysis methods, we are designing a series of data challenges that will provide the scientific community with high-quality data sets for testing and evaluating new techniques. In this paper, we present a description and results from the first such Science Data Challenge 1 (SDC1). Based on SKA MID continuum simulated observations and covering three frequencies (560, 1400, and 9200 MHz) at three depths (8, 100, and 1000 h), SDC1 asked participants to apply source detection, characterization, and classification methods to simulated data. The challenge opened in 2018 November, with nine teams submitting results by the deadline of 2019 April. In this work, we analyse the results for eight of those teams, showcasing the variety of approaches that can be successfully used to find, characterize, and classify sources in a deep, crowded field. The results also demonstrate the importance of building domain knowledge and expertise on this kind of analysis to obtain the best performance. As high-resolution observations begin revealing the true complexity of the sky, one of the outstanding challenges emerging from this analysis is the ability to deal with highly resolved and complex sources as effectively as the unresolved source population.},

The shared data model with AIPS means almost complete interoperability, allowing algorithmic development in a production environment. The Obit package supports both prepackaged, compiled tasks and a python interface to the major class functionality to allow rapid prototyping using python scripts. Developed features are predominantly radio astronomical, but support for astronomical images and tables is generic and should allow a wider range of applications. The design is intended to be readily extensible. An example is given that explores the effect of ``CLEAN bias'' in the VLA Low-Frequency Sky Survey and compares its method of CLEAN to an automated CLEAN window selection scheme that should reduce the bias. This technique shows much promise for reducing this systematic effect.},

  abstract = {In a six-year program started in 2014 July, the Extended Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (eBOSS) will conduct novel cosmological observations using the BOSS spectrograph at Apache Point Observatory. These observations will be conducted simultaneously with the Time Domain Spectroscopic Survey (TDSS) designed for variability studies and the Spectroscopic Identification of eROSITA Sources (SPIDERS) program designed for studies of X-ray sources. In particular, eBOSS will measure with percent-level precision the distance-redshift relation with baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) in the clustering of matter. eBOSS will use four different tracers of the underlying matter density field to vastly expand the volume covered by BOSS and map the large-scalestructures over the relatively unconstrained redshift range 0.6{$<$}z{$<$}2.2. Using more than 250,000 new, spectroscopically confirmed luminous red galaxies at a median redshift z=0.72, we project that eBOSS will yield measurements of the angular diameter distance dA(z) to an accuracy of 1.2\% and measurements of H(z) to 2.1\% when combined with the z{$>$}0.6 sample of BOSS galaxies. With {$\sim$}195,000 new emission line galaxy redshifts, we expect BAO measurements of dA(z) to an accuracy of 3.1\% and H(z) to 4.7\% at an effective redshift of z=0.87. A sample of more than 500,000 spectroscopically confirmed quasars will provide the first BAO distance measurements over the redshift range 0.9{$<$}z{$<$}2.2, with expected precision of 2.8\% and 4.2\% on dA(z) and H(z), respectively. Finally, with 60,000 new quasars and re-observation of 60,000 BOSS quasars, we will obtain new Ly{$\alpha$} forest measurements at redshifts z{$>$}2.1; these new data will enhance the precision of dA(z) and H(z) at z{$>$}2.1 by a factor of 1.44 relative to BOSS. Furthermore, eBOSS will provide improved tests of General Relativity on cosmological scales through redshift-space distortion measurements, improved tests for nonGaussianity in the primordial density field, and new constraints on the summed mass of all neutrino species. Here, we provide an overview of the cosmological goals, spectroscopic target sample, demonstration of spectral quality from early data, and projected cosmological constraints from eBOSS.},

  abstract = {The MHONGOOSE (MeerKAT H i Observations of Nearby Galactic Objects: Observing Southern Emitters) survey maps the distribution and kinematics of the neutral atomic hydrogen (H i) gas in and around 30 nearby star-forming spiral and dwarf galaxies to extremely low H i column densities. The H i column density sensitivity (3{$\sigma$} over 16 km s-1) ranges from {$\sim$}5 {\texttimes} 1017 cm-2 at 90{$\prime\prime$} resolution to {$\sim$}4 {\texttimes} 1019 cm-2 at the highest resolution of 7{$\prime\prime$}. The H i mass sensitivity (3{$\sigma$} over 50 km s-1) is {$\sim$}5.5{\texttimes}105 M at a distance of 10 Mpc (the median distance of the sample galaxies). The velocity resolution of the data is 1.4 km s-1. One of the main science goals of the survey is the detection of cold accreting gas in the outskirts of the sample galaxies. The sample was selected to cover a range in H i masses from 107 M to almost 1011 M in order to optimally sample possible accretion scenarios and environments. The distance to the sample galaxies ranges from 3 to 23 Mpc. In this paper, we present the sample selection, survey design, and observation and reduction procedures. We compared the integrated H i fluxes based on the MeerKAT data with those derived from single-dish measurement and find good agreement, indicating that our MeerKAT observations are recovering all flux. We present H i moment maps of the entire sample based on the first ten percent of the survey data, and find that a comparison of the zeroth- and second-moment values shows a clear separation in the physical properties of the H i between areas with star formation and areas without related to the formation of a cold neutral medium. Finally, we give an overview of the H i-detected companion and satellite galaxies in the 30 fields, five of which have not previously been cataloged. We find a clear relation between the number of companion galaxies and the mass of the main target galaxy.},

This paper outlines how the scientific challenges are translated into technical challenges, how the application of recent technology offers the potential of affordably meeting these challenges, and how the choices of technology will ultimately be made. The SKA will be an array of coherently connected antennas spread over an area about 3000 km in extent, with an aggregate antenna collecting area of up to 106 m2 at centimeter and meter wavelengths. A key scientific requirement is the ability to carry out sensitive observations of the sky over large areas (surveys). The Bsurvey speed[ of the SKA will be enabled by the application of the most up-to-date signal-processing technology available. The SKA science impact will be widely felt in astroparticle physics and cosmology, fundamental physics, galactic and extragalactic astronomy, solar system science, and astrobiology.},

By exploiting Parallelized rotation and flipping INvariant Kohonen maps (PINK), a self-organizing map (SOM) algorithm, we are able to associate radio and infrared sources without the a priori requirement of training labels. We present an example of this method using 894 415 images from the Faint Images of the Radio-Sky at Twenty centimeters (FIRST) and Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) surveys centred towards positions described by the FIRST catalogue. We produce a set of catalogues that complement FIRST and describe 802 646 objects, including their radio components and their corresponding AllWISE infrared host galaxy. Using these data products, we (i) demonstrate the ability to identify objects with rare and unique radio morphologies (e.g. `X'-shaped galaxies, hybrid FR I/FR II morphologies), (ii) can identify the potentially resolved radio components that are associated with a single infrared host, (iii) introduce a `curliness' statistic to search for bent and disturbed radio morphologies, and (iv) extract a set of 17 giant radio galaxies between 700 and 1100 kpc. As we require no training labels, our method can be applied to any radio-continuum survey, provided a sufficiently representative SOM can be trained.},

  abstract = {We describe the design, construction, and performance of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey telescope located at Apache Point Observatory. The telescope is a modified two-corrector Ritchey-Chre{\textasciiacute}tien design with a 2.5 m, f/2.25 primary, a 1.08 m secondary, a Gascoigne astigmatism corrector, and one of a pair of interchangeable highly aspheric correctors near the focal plane, one for imaging and the other for spectroscopy. The final focal ratio is f/5. The telescope is instrumented by a wide-area, multiband CCD camera and a pair of fiber-fed double spectrographs. Novel features of the telescope include the following: (1) A 3 diameter (0.65 m) focal plane that has excellent image quality and small geometric distortions over a wide wavelength range (3000--10,600 8) in the imaging mode, and good image quality combined with very small lateral and longitudinal color errors in the spectroscopic mode. The unusual requirement of very low distortion is set by the demands of time-delay-and-integrate (TDI) imaging. (2) Very high precision motion to support open-loop TDI observations. (3) A unique wind baffle/enclosure construction to maximize image quality and minimize construction costs. The telescope had first light in 1998 May and began regular survey operations in 2000.},

  abstract = {We present details of the Automated Radio Telescope Imaging Pipeline (ARTIP) and the results of a sensitive blind search for H I and OH absorbers at z{$<$}0.4 and z{$<$}0.7, respectively. ARTIP is written in Python 3.6, extensively uses the Common Astronomy Software Application tools and tasks, and is designed to enable the geographically distributed MeerKAT Absorption Line Survey (MALS) team to collaboratively process large volumes of radio interferometric data. We apply it to the first MALS data set obtained using the 64-dish MeerKAT radio telescope and 32 K channel mode of the correlator. With merely 40 minutes on target, we present the most sensitive spectrum of PKS 1830-211 ever obtained and characterize the known H I (z=0.19) and OH (z=0.89) absorbers. We further demonstrate ARTIP's capabilities to handle realistic observing scenarios by applying it to a sample of 72 bright radio sources observed with the upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (uGMRT) to blindly search for H I and OH absorbers. We estimate the numbers of H I and OH absorbers per unit redshift to be n21(z{$\sim$}0.18){$<$}0.14 and nOH(z{$\sim$}0.40){$<$}0.12, respectively, and constrain the cold gas covering factor of galaxies at large impact parameters (50 kpc{$<$}{$\rho$}{$<$}150 kpc) to be less than 0.022. Due to the small redshift path, {$\Delta$}z{$\sim$}13 for H I with column density {$>$}5.4{\texttimes}1019 cm-2, the survey has probed only the outskirts of star-forming galaxies at {$\rho$}{$>$}30 kpc. MALS with the expected {$\Delta$}z{$\sim$}103--4 will overcome this limitation and provide stringent constraints on the cold gas fraction of galaxies in diverse environments over 0{$<$}z{$<$}1.5.},

  abstract = {The Square Kilometre Array Observatory (SKAO) will explore the radio sky to new depths in order to conduct transformational science. SKAO data products made available to astronomers will be correspondingly large and complex, requiring the application of advanced analysis techniques to extract key science findings. To this end, SKAO is conducting a series of Science Data Challenges, each designed to familiarize the scientific community with SKAO data and to drive the development of new analysis techniques. We present the results from Science Data Challenge 2 (SDC2), which invited participants to find and characterize 233 245 neutral hydrogen (H I) sources in a simulated data product representing a 2000 h SKA-Mid spectral line observation from redshifts 0.25--0.5. Through the generous support of eight international supercomputing facilities, participants were able to undertake the Challenge using dedicated computational resources. Alongside the main challenge, `reproducibility awards' were made in recognition of those pipelines which demonstrated Open Science best practice. The Challenge saw over 100 participants develop a range of new and existing techniques, with results that highlight the strengths of multidisciplinary and collaborative effort. The winning strategy -- which combined predictions from two independent machine learning techniques to yield a 20 per cent improvement in overall performance -- underscores one of the main Challenge outcomes: that of method complementarity. It is likely that the combination of methods in a so-called ensemble approach will be key to exploiting very large astronomical data sets.},

  abstract = {We describe here the most ambitious survey currently planned in the optical, the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST). The LSST design is driven by four main science themes: probing dark energy and dark matter, taking an inventory of the solar system, exploring the transient optical sky, and mapping the Milky Way. LSST will be a large, wide-field ground-based system designed to obtain repeated images covering the sky visible from Cerro Pach{\'o}n in northern Chile. The telescope will have an 8.4 m (6.5 m effective) primary mirror, a 9.6 deg2 field of view, a 3.2-gigapixel camera, and six filters (ugrizy) covering the wavelength range 320--1050 nm. The project is in the construction phase and will begin regular survey operations by 2022. About 90\% of the observing time will be devoted to a deep-wide-fast survey mode that will uniformly observe a 18,000 deg2 region about 800 times (summed over all six bands) during the anticipated 10 yr of operations and will yield a co-added map to r{$\sim$}27.5. These data will result in databases including about 32 trillion observations of 20 billion galaxies and a similar number of stars, and they will serve the majority of the primary science programs. The remaining 10\% of the observing time will be allocated to special projects such as Very Deep and Very Fast time domain surveys, whose details are currently under discussion. We illustrate how the LSST science drivers led to these choices of system parameters, and we describe the expected data products and their characteristics.},

In this short review, we provide a brief history of CCDs in astronomy and then describe their operation as they are most commonly implemented for scientific imaging. We discuss specialized CCD sensors which have been developed and effectively utilized in modern astronomical instrumentation. We conclude with an overview of the characterization of CCDs as performed in detector laboratories and at telescopes and discuss anticipated future advances.},

  abstract = {The Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE), one of the programs in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey III (SDSS-III), has now completed its systematic, homogeneous spectroscopic survey sampling all major populations of the Milky Way. After a three-year observing campaign on the Sloan 2.5 m Telescope, APOGEE has collected a half million high-resolution (R{$\sim$}22,500), high signal-to-noise ratio ({$>$}100), infrared (1.51--1.70 {$\mu$}m) spectra for 146,000 stars, with time series information via repeat visits to most of these stars. This paper describes the motivations for the survey and its overall design---hardware, field placement, target selection, operations---and gives an overview of these aspects as well as the data reduction, analysis, and products. An index is also given to the complement of technical papers that describe various critical survey components in detail. Finally, we discuss the achieved survey performance and illustrate the variety of potential uses of the data products by way of a number of science demonstrations, which span from time series analysis of stellar spectral variations and radial velocity variations from stellar companions, to spatial maps of kinematics, metallicity, and abundance patterns across the Galaxy and as a function of age, to new views of the interstellar medium, the chemistry of star clusters, and the discovery of rare stellar species. As part of SDSS-III Data Release 12 and later releases, all of the APOGEE data products are publicly available.},

  abstract = {The unprecedented volume and rate of transient events that will be discovered by the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) demand that the astronomical community update its follow-up paradigm. Alert-brokers---automated software system to sift through, characterize, annotate, and prioritize events for follow-up---will be critical tools for managing alert streams in the LSST era. The Arizona-NOAO Temporal Analysis and Response to Events System (ANTARES) is one such broker. In this work, we develop a machine learning pipeline to characterize and classify variable and transient sources only using the available multiband optical photometry. We describe three illustrative stages of the pipeline, serving the three goals of early, intermediate, and retrospective classification of alerts. The first takes the form of variable versus transient categorization, the second a multiclass typing of the combined variable and transient data set, and the third a purity-driven subtyping of a transient class. Although several similar algorithms have proven themselves in simulations, we validate their performance on real observations for the first time. We quantitatively evaluate our pipeline on sparse, unevenly sampled, heteroskedastic data from various existing observational campaigns, and demonstrate very competitive classification performance. We describe our progress toward adapting the pipeline developed in this work into a real-time broker working on live alert streams from time-domain surveys.},

Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) by the LSST Dark Energy Science Collaboration (LSST DESC). Significant connections across multiple science domains will be a hallmark of LSST; the DC2 program represents a unique modeling effort that stresses this interconnectivity in a way that has not been attempted before. This effort encompasses a full end-to-end approach: starting from a large               N               -body simulation, through setting up LSST-like observations including realistic cadences, through image simulations, and finally processing with Rubin's LSST Science Pipelines. This last step ensures that we generate data products resembling those to be delivered by the Rubin Observatory as closely as is currently possible. The simulated DC2 sky survey covers six optical bands in a wide-fast-deep area of approximately 300 deg               2               , as well as a deep drilling field of approximately 1 deg               2               . We simulate 5 yr of the planned 10 yr survey. The DC2 sky survey has multiple purposes. First, the LSST DESC working groups can use the data set to develop a range of DESC analysis pipelines to prepare for the advent of actual data. Second, it serves as a realistic test bed for the image processing software under development for LSST by the Rubin Observatory. In particular, simulated data provide a controlled way to investigate certain image-level systematic effects. Finally, the DC2 sky survey enables the exploration of new scientific ideas in both static and time domain cosmology.},

We also compare our results with earlier analyses by Dreyer (1916, Tychonis Brahe Dani Scripta Astronomica, Vol. II) and Rawlins (1993, DIO, 3, 1), finding good overall agreement. The magnitudes given by Brahe correlate well with modern values, his longitudes and latitudes have error distributions with widths of 2{$\prime$}, with excess numbers of stars with larger errors (as compared to Gaussian distributions), in particular for the faintest stars. Errors in positions larger than 10{$\prime$}, which comprise about 15\% of the entries, are likely due to computing or copying errors.},
